Basic 2D Non-Euclidian Renderer
-------------------------------

This places you in the shoes of a 2D being that lives in a cubical space, that is basically spherical space but with lovelly singularities at the corners of the cube.

It runs in browser, just open index.html.

If you want to build your own map face, use Processing and open CreateMapForDoom and use your mose to cycle through colors, anything not white is solid. When happy, press any button on the keyboard and paste the output from the console into one of the variables in maps.js.
